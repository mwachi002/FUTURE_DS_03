I worked on a data analysis project using google colab where I analyzed student feedback ratings to understand satisfaction trends and identify areas for improvement. 


Insight:
The highest average rating is for Well versed with the subject and this indicates that instructors are highly knowledgeable in their respective subjects.


Recommendation:
To continue prioritizing instructors who are passionate with their subjects.
